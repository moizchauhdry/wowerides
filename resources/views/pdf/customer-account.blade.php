            <p>All WOW Electric Rides (referred to as WER) products, including E-Bikes, E-Scooters, E-Motorcycles,
                Hoverboards, and E-Kids Cars (referred to as PRODUCT),
                and their individual Covered Components are protected against all manufacturing defects in material or
                workmanship for a period of _____ years for the
                frame and _____ years for the motor/battery (the “Warranty Period”). This Limited Warranty is only
                applicable to Canadian purchases and is subject to the
                following terms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Limited Warranty is only applicable to the original owner who purchased the product from WER's
                    online or physical storefront. The Warranty Period
                    begins upon shipping of the product and ends immediately upon the earlier of the end of the Warranty
                    Period, any sale, or transfer to another person. Under
                    no circumstances shall the Limited Warranty apply to any subsequent owner or other transferee.</li>
                <li>The Limited Warranty is expressly limited to the replacement of a defective lithium-ion battery (the
                    “Battery”), frame, forks, stem, handlebar, headset, seat
                    post, saddle, brakes, lights, bottom bracket, crankset, pedals, rims, wheel hub, freewheel,

                    harness, LCD display, kickstand, reflectors, and hardware (each a “Covered Component”).</li>
                <li>The Covered Components are warranted to be free of defects in materials and/or workmanship during
                    the Warranty Period.
                    If WER determines a Covered Component is defective, WER will, as your sole and exclusive remedy and
                    at WER’s sole discretion:
                    <br>
                    (a) repair the defective Covered Component free of charge with new or refurbished parts; or
                    <br>
                    (b) replace the defective Covered Component with a new Covered Component.
                    <br>
                    Determining whether damage or defect to a WER product or covered component is protected by this
                    limited warranty shall be in the sole discretion of
                    WER.

            <b>Shipping & Handling</b>
            <p>This Limited Warranty does not cover damage to Covered Components incurred during shipping, but WER may
                replace such damaged Covered Components if
                you follow these steps:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Notify WER of any Covered Components damaged during shipping within 7 days of your original receipt.
                </li>
                <li>Provide WER with a dated picture of the damaged Covered Component.</li>
                <li>Return all original packaging and paperwork included with the product at your sole cost, unless WER
                    agrees in writing to pay for your shipping costs.</li>
                <li>Note any immediately recognizable damage on the shipper’s Bill of Lading prior to signing off on the
                    shipment.</li>
                <li>Shipping damage claims are time-sensitive, and it is your responsibility to inspect the product for
                    damage upon receipt and report it immediately.</li>
                <li>If you choose to use your own independent shipping method, such as a freight forwarder or other
                    similar service, WER will not replace any Covered
                    Components damaged during such shipping.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note that any Covered Components that are damaged during shipping must be reported to WER within 7 days
                of your original receipt to be eligible for
                replacement. Additionally, any immediately recognizable damage to the product or its packaging should be
                noted on the shipper’s Bill of Lading prior to
                signing off on the shipment.</p>
